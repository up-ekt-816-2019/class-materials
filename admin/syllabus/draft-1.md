## Probability and Statistics Review
Distributions, expectations, quantiles. Laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Estimation: mean square error vs bias. Sufficient and ancilliary statistics. Consistency and precision in estimation. Weighting and sample design. Identification. Hypothesis testing: size vs power.

## Causality and Counterfactuals
Potential outcomes notation. Randomization delivers the ATE; brief aside on SUTVA, peer effects and general equilibrium. Examples of causal claims (especially implicit ones). Typical obstacles to estimating counterfactuals: simultaneity, measurement error, self-selection. Internal and external validity, and the value of understanding mechanisms. The importance of a clear research design. Another aside on partial identification and "structural estimation". Prediction vs causation. Citation to @Manski1995.

## Selection on Observables: Regression

## Instrumental Variables 

## Panel Data Strategies

### Repeated Cross Sections (Synthetic Panels)

### Individual-Level Panel Data

Complications: lagged dependent variables.

#### Mover Designs

#### Event Studies
