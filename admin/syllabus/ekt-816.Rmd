# Course Description

This is a graduate course in econometrics. Our goal is to learn some basic techniques that economists use to (try to) establish causal claims. At a higher level, you will also need to learn how to assemble such claims together so as to build a coherent argument, but you have a little longer to learn how to do that.

# Required Texts

# Class Schedule

Please read at least the prescribed readings before class, even if you find it hard to follow everything. It will become easier with practice.

## `r advdate(mon, 1)`: Probability and Statistics Review
Distributions, expectations, quantiles. Laws of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Estimation: mean square error vs bias. Sufficient and ancilliary statistics.

## `r advdate(mon, 2)`: Probability and Statistics Review (continued)
Consistency and precision in estimation. Weighting and sample design. Identification. Hypothesis testing: size vs power.

## `r advdate(mon, 3)`: Counterfactuals and Causal Inference
Potential outcomes notation. Randomization delivers the ATE; brief aside on SUTVA, peer effects and general equilibrium.   Examples of causal claims (especially implicit ones). Typical obstacles to estimating counterfactuals: simultaneity, measurement error, self-selection. Internal and external validity, and the value of understanding mechanisms. The importance of a clear research design. Another aside on partial identification and "structural estimation". Prediction vs causation.
